/**
 * THE FIRST ADMINISTRATOR — the one account an installation cannot make through
 * a screen, because every screen is behind the sign-in it does not yet have.
 *
 * THE CORE'S COMMANDS ARE THE ONES A PRODUCTION BUILD MUST RUN, AND THIS IS
 * ONE OF THEM. A production installation is built without development
 * packages, and the account an operator has to make is needed exactly there:
 * on the server, once, after the deploy.
 *
 *     docker exec <web> php bin/console identity:user:create
 *
 * NO SETUP SCREEN. A page that creates the first administrator is a page that
 * must be reachable by a stranger, and one that has to be closed afterwards by
 * something remembering that it was used. A command is reachable by whoever can
 * already reach a shell on the server, which is the authority the account is
 * being granted anyway.
 *
 *     identity:user:create [<email> <first name> <last name>] [--tier=…] [--password=…]
 *
 * IT ASKS FOR WHAT IT WAS NOT TOLD. The person running this is at the console
 * of an installation with no account in it, and the tail above is four things
 * long, so anything missing from it is asked for in the order it is written:
 * the address, the two names, the tier, and last the passphrase.
 *
 *     $ bin/console identity:user:create
 *      Email address:
 *      > ada@example.test
 *      First name:
 *      > Ada
 *      Last name:
 *      > Mwangi
 *      Tier [super-admin]:
 *       [0] super-admin
 *       [1] admin
 *       [2] staff
 *      >
 *      Passphrase (not shown):
 *      >
 *
 *      [OK] Created Ada Mwangi <ada@example.test> as Super Admin.
 *
 * A TAIL THAT NAMED EVERYTHING IS ASKED NOTHING BUT THE PASSPHRASE, and that
 * rule is what keeps the piped form working even at a terminal: a tier question
 * put to a pipe would be answered by the line the passphrase was on.
 *
 *     printf '%s' "$PASSPHRASE" | bin/console identity:user:create ada@example.test Ada Mwangi
 *
 * THE PASSPHRASE IS NEVER ECHOED AND NEVER ASKED FOR TWICE. It is read through
 * a hidden {@see Question} where there is somebody to ask, and off standard
 * input where there is not — the shape Symfony's own password command has, down
 * to the stream it reads.
 *
 * @see vendor/symfony/password-hasher/Command/UserPasswordHashCommand.php
 *
 * THE TIER DEFAULTS TO SUPER ADMIN, because the account this exists to make is
 * the one an installation is bootstrapped with, and a first administrator who
 * could not administer would leave nobody who can.
 *
 * IT WRITES NOTHING ITSELF. Making an account is one set of rules, held by
 * {@see UserService} and called by every screen that adds somebody; a command
 * with its own hasher and its own entity manager would be a second copy of them,
 * drifting from the first the moment either changed.
